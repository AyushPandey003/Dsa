# DSA Preparation Repository

Welcome to the DSA Preparation Repository! This repository contains solutions to over 100 Data Structures and Algorithms problems from various platforms like LeetCode, solved in Python, Java, and C++. Each problem comes with a detailed README that includes intuition, pro tips, and the approach used to solve it.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subfolders such as `neetcode 150`, `fathers day`, `mothers day`, and more. Each subfolder groups related problems together.

## Run Guide

To run the solutions, use the following command-line instructions based on the programming language:

- **Python**:
  Navigate to the directory containing the Python file and execute:
  ```sh
  python filename.py
  ```
  *Note*: Ensure Python is installed (e.g., `python --version` to check).

- **Java**:
  Compile and run the Java file with these steps:
  1. Compile:
     ```sh
     javac filename.java
     ```
  2. Run:
     ```sh
     java filename
     ```
  *Note*: Requires JDK installed (check with `javac -version`).

- **C++**:
  Compile and run the C++ file with these steps:
  1. Compile:
     ```sh
     g++ filename.cpp -o outputname
     ```
  2. Run:
     ```sh
     ./outputname
     ```
  *Note*: Requires a C++ compiler like g++ (check with `g++ --version`).

## Problem READMEs

Each problem has its own README file that provides:

- **Intuition**: A brief explanation of the thought process behind the solution.
- **Pro Tips**: Helpful tips and tricks to solve the problem efficiently.
- **Approach**: A step-by-step breakdown of the solution.

## Navigation

Explore the subfolders to find problems categorized by themes or difficulty levels. Some examples include:

- [Father's Day](./fathersDay)
- [Mother's Day](./mothersDay)
These READMEs are designed to help you not only understand the code but also improve your problem-solving skills.
